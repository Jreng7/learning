# Repository of Various Projects

This repository contains a collection of individual projects, where each folder corresponds to a specific project. The projects may be developed in different programming languages and utilize various technologies, depending on the goal of each one.

## **Important Note**
None of the folders in this repository contain "video lessons." Instead, they include **notes and code files** that I created while following the lessons I watched. This repository is focused on the practical implementation and experimentation of the concepts learned.

## **Project Structure**
Each folder within this repository represents a distinct project. Below is the list of folders and their respective descriptions:

- `video_01`: Description of the first project. (Replace with specific details)

## **Usage Instructions**
To explore any project:

1. Navigate to the folder corresponding to the project of interest.  
2. Inside each folder, you will find a specific `README.md` file containing more details about the project, such as its functionalities, the technologies used, and execution instructions.

## **Additional Information**
All courses related to these projects are free, with the exception of Rocketseat and b7web. However, I decided to include Rocketseat projects in this folder as well for convenience.

This repository serves as a space for learning and experimenting with different technologies and concepts.
